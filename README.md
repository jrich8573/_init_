II. Application Arrangment:
---

  1. OS X (soon to be macOS)
    a. Windows 7 (work)
    b. CentOS 7 (work)
  2. iTerm2
    a. In Windows I use Babun Unix emulator (which has oh-my-zsh package within. See #10 below)
  3. Homebrew package manager (MacPorts could be used, I just prefer HB)
  4. ViM (the plugins are listed in the .vimrc file)
  5. R and R-Studio
  6. Python (mostly 2.7.x, but I written networking tools with 3.4.x)
  7. noodejs (testing)
  8. tmux, although iTerm2 allows tabs, I have used tmux for sometime and I just easier for me)
  9. emacs ( I use org mode in emacs for tracking TODO's and notes, and I do have evil package loaded in emacs to emulate ViM). 
  10. My shell of chioce is oh-my-zsh (http://ohmyz.sh/)
    a. git configured, and thus I rarely utilize GitHub for Mac (or for Windows at work). Thus, configuring git is essential.
